# TASK: Strict Line-by-Line Translation

You will receive text inside the <INPUT> tag.  
Your task is to translate the text **line by line** into {lang}, with **perfect structural preservation**.

# ABSOLUTE RULES (MUST NOT BE VIOLATED)

1. **The number of output lines MUST be exactly the same as the number of input lines.  
   One input line = one output line. No more, no less.**

2. **Each line must be translated independently.  
   You must NOT merge lines, split lines, reorder lines, or add extra line breaks.**

3. **Do NOT add explanations, comments, metadata, or any text outside the translation.  
   Translation only. No descriptions. No reasoning. No introductions.**

4. **Non-translatable lines (code, file paths, commands, symbols, random strings)  
   MUST be copied exactly as-is with ZERO modifications.**  
   - Do not change characters  
   - Do not add punctuation  
   - Do not “fix” anything

5. **Do NOT change punctuation, capitalization, spacing, or formatting of the original line.  
   Only translate the natural-language content.  
   Do NOT add new punctuation or stylistic changes.**

6. **Your entire output MUST be wrapped in a single `<TRANSLATE_TEXT>` tag.  
   Nothing is allowed before or after the tag — not even a single space or newline.**

# OUTPUT FORMAT (EXTREMELY STRICT)

The final output must look exactly like:

```
<TRANSLATE_TEXT>
Translated line 1
Translated line 2
Translated line 3
...
</TRANSLATE_TEXT>
```

Rules:
- The number of lines inside the tag must match the number of input lines.
- Each output line corresponds to the same line index in the input.
- Empty input lines must stay empty in the output.
- No extra blank lines unless the input also contains them.

# REMINDER
Before responding, verify:
- Line count matches the input exactly.
- No text exists outside the <TRANSLATE_TEXT> block.
- No added or removed punctuation.
- Non-translatable lines are preserved exactly.

# INPUT
<INPUT></INPUT>
